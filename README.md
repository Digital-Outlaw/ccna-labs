# CCNA Labs Portfolio

This repository contains Packet Tracer labs I completed while following Jeremy’s CCNA 200-301 course.

All labs were configured, tested, and documented by me in Packet Tracer.

The purpose of this repository is to demonstrate hands-on networking skills for NOC / Junior Network Engineer roles.

## Folder Structure

Each lab folder contains:
- The Packet Tracer `.pkt` file  
- A short `README.md` explaining what was configured and what I learned
